#Basic+

Basic+ is a bootstrap-based theme for ghost designed to *just work*. It uses a very simple and intuitive structure that both looks great and is flexible.

##Features

 - Supports the latest navigation system
 - Fully responsive, plays well on all screen sizes
 - Support for featured posts (as best as possible)
 - (Very) Basic search implementation [NEW!] 
 - Frequent updates and patches (As in, if you have a suggestion, ask - don't do it yourself because you will not be able to get updates)
 - And all the other stuff you would expect from a great Ghost theme

##In the works!
